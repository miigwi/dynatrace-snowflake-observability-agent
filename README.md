# Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent

**Dynatrace Snowflake Observability Agent (DSOA)** is a powerful tool designed to enhance [Data Platform Observability](DPO.md) within the
Snowflake environment. It complements Dynatrace's capabilities by [extending observability with plugins](PLUGINS.md) into areas where
traditional OneAgent or synthetic monitoring may not reach. DSOA provides [comprehensive telemetry data](SEMANTICS.md) for monitoring,
analyzing, and detecting anomalies in data processing. It delivers observability data in the form of OpenTelemetry
[logs](ARCHITECTURE.md#sending-logs) and [spans](ARCHITECTURE.md#sending-tracesspans), as well as Dynatrace
[metrics](ARCHITECTURE.md#sending-metrics), [events](ARCHITECTURE.md#sending-events), and
[business events (CloudEvents)](ARCHITECTURE.md#sending-bizevents), ensuring a seamless integration with Dynatrace's observability platform.
